  "description": "User input is reflected inside a <noscript> tag. When JavaScript is enabled, the content of <noscript> behaves like CDATA, meaning no HTML or scripts inside it are parsed. To trigger XSS, the attacker must close the <noscript> tag and switch back into normal HTML parsing context before injecting active HTML/JavaScript.",
  "objectives": [
    "Understand how <noscript> behaves when JavaScript is enabled.",
    "Recognize why CDATA-like content inside <noscript> is not parsed.",
    "Escape the noscript element to re-enter normal HTML parsing and inject JavaScript."
  ],
  "hints": [
    "Content inside <noscript> is treated as plain text and not parsed.",
    "Consider what happens if the noscript tag is closed early.",
    "Once outside the noscript tag, normal HTML parsing resumes.",
